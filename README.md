**Preliminary questions**

**1) What technical/business constraints should the data storage component of theprogram architecture meet to fulfill the requirement described by the customer inparagraph «Statistics»?**

 We have to store the data for a certain duration and the we got a huge amount of data (200Go). So using a data lake is the best option.
 Financially, it's also affordable. So this option seems a good idea.

**2)What business constraint should the architecture meet to fulfill the requirementdescribe in the paragraph «Alert»? Which component to choose?**
  
  The first business constraint is financial, you will need a lot of peacewatcher to analyse all the population at the same time

**3)What mistake(s) from Peaceland can explain the failed attempt?**
  
  A bad model and works on the IA.

**4)Peaceland has likely forgotten some technical information in the report sent by thedrone. In the future, this information could help Peaceland make its peacewatchersmuch more efficient. Which information?**
